# CV_MIU
## Target user profile ##
This curriculum is oriented to the world of programming. Be it Back-end, Front-end or Ui/Ux. It shows what tools to use in addition to the different languages I know since I consider it is an important part.
##  Information architecture ##
The css code include various CSS styles for different sections of the CV, such as the header, skills, education, contact information, and more. It's also included some responsive design using media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes such as mobile, computer or larger screens.

### Here's a description for the different sections: ###
Divided into two parts with **grid** and other sections divided with **flexboxes**.

1.**.esq**: This is the left-side section, which seems to contain the personal photo, introduction, working skills, and languages.

2.**.dreta**: This is the right-side section, which contains the name, contact information, education, and other details.

3.**.recabout**: A rectangular box for self-introduction.

4.**.skills**: A section for listing the working skills.

5.**.workingskills**: Divided into different categories, like Front-end, Back-end, Ui/Ux, and Game development skills.

6.**.languages**: A section for listing the languages.

7.**.language**: Divided into different languages like Catalan, Spanish, English, French, and Japanese.

8.**.cont**: A section for contact information.

9.**.flex-container**: Contains contact information sections, including phone number, address, LinkedIn, and Gmail.

10.**.telefo, .ubic, .linkedin, .gmail**: These are individual sections for each contact information type.

11.**.educa**: A section for the education information.

12.**.educapart**: Contains information about the education, such as the year, institution, and location.

13.**.expepart**:  A section for the experience information.

14.**.cerclehobbie**: Contains some hobbies.

## Visual design ##
The page is divided into two parts.
1. On the left side there is a turquoise rectangle where we have a photo of myself and general information about me such as a small description, the skills I know for each part and the languages.
2. On the right side we find my name and the engineering I do. There is also more specific and more explanatory information. There is the contacts part where my phone number, location, linkedin and gmail are. Next we have the education part with the three most recent things I have done or am doing. In the next part we have the experience I have in some sectors and finally some of the hobbies.
  #### Findings ####
  Some problems I've had:
  We can see that the contact part is not aligned correctly like the line on the education part. These parts previously overlapped or did not move as they should. This part has been fixed by making adaptations     for each screen and using borders to make it easier to manage the lines created.
